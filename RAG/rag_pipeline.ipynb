A few travelers claimed to have met an “Indian scientist” there who could hear birds and tell you the humidity. Possibly him.\\n\\nSince 2017 — silence. No papers, no sightings. Just a few forum posts speculating he sold his SEG blueprint to a private aerospace company. Some believe his work is buried deep inside experimental AI used in submarines or drones. Others think he just retired and listens to the ocean now.\\n\\nNo photos exist, except maybe a blurred university archive one. No interviews.
